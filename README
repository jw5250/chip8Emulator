This emulator was made with the following quirks in mind:
  60hz draw rate (max 60 draws per second)
  For bitshifting, only X register is used
  Screen wrapping enabled
  load, store register instruction increments index register.
This program was tested on:
Timendus's test files (https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)
Several files from an octojam chip8 archive (https://github.com/JohnEarnest/chip8Archive)
  ROMS with no issues
    down8.ch8
      Requires wrapping for the intro cutscene to play properly.
    glitchGhost.ch8
      Playable with and without uncapped framerates
    petdog.ch8
    slipperyslope.ch8
      Speed of the player during the level transitions is dependent on framerate speeds.
    snek.ch8
      Speed dependent on framerate speed.
    RPS.ch8
      Requires the draw rate be capped at 60 to be completely playable. (cutscene plays too fast otherwise.)
    br8kout.ch8
      Playable with or without capped framerates.
    All of the "octojam[number]title.ch8" files except 1.
      1 only works properly if wrapping for this emulator is on.
    piper.ch8
      Playable if the draw rate is uncapped. Otherwise stutters a lot and the waves take much longer to come.
  Semi-playable (ROM is semi-playable)
    danm8ku.ch8
      This game is not playable with a max 60 frame rate. Once the second wave of bullets comes on it chugs super hard.
      Bullets don't exit at the other end of the screen. They just stay there.
  Completely breaks (ROM is completely unplayable)
Several chip8 files from this chip8 archive: https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms/tree/master/games
      Space Invaders
        Not entirely sure if this one works properly.
      Tetris
        Playable.
      Pong (1 player)
        Playable.
      Breakout (David Winter)
        Breakout game that works.
