This emulator was made with chip8 configurations in mind.
This program was tested on:
Timendus's test files (https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)
  Issues:
    Not entirely sure how to fix the drawing issue.
Several files from the chip8 archive (https://github.com/JohnEarnest/chip8Archive)
  ROMS with no issues (as of current testing):
    down8.ch8
    glitchGhost.ch8
      Not sure about this one.
    petdog.ch8
    piper.ch8
  Current issues:
    Several ROMs run way too fast on certain areas.
      ROMs:
        RPS.ch8
        octojam2title.ch8
        octojam5title.ch8
        slipperyslope.ch8
          The main gameplay works fine, but the man skating in the cutscenes moves too fast.
        snek.ch8
          Playable, but moves faster than it probably should.
        danm8ku.ch8
          Not too sure if the bullets are supposed to move as fast as they do in this game.
    Draw Issues
      ROMs:

    Completely breaks (ROM is completely unplayable)

          I can "move" but the game doesn't actually proceed.

          Freezes at initialization.
