This emulator was made with chip8 configurations in mind.
This program was tested on:
Timendus's test files (https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)
Several files from an octojam chip8 archive (https://github.com/JohnEarnest/chip8Archive)
  ROMS with no issues (as of current testing):
    down8.ch8
      Requires wrapping for the intro cutscene to play properly.
    glitchGhost.ch8
      Instructions are only read on odd addresses. Why?
    petdog.ch8
    piper.ch8
    slipperyslope.ch8
    snek.ch8
    RPS.ch8
    br8kout.ch8
    All of the "octojam[number]title.ch8" files except 1.
      NOTE:When looking at the source code, it seems this one is dependent on wrapping being on for the bat to loop correctly
  Not playable (ROM is semi-playable)
    danm8ku.ch8
      Title screen (danm8ku) doesn't display
      Bullets don't exit at the other end of the screen. They just stay there.
  Completely breaks (ROM is completely unplayable)
Several chip8 files from this chip8 archive: https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms/tree/master/games
      Space Invaders
        Not entirely sure if this one works properly.
      Tetris
        Playable, but doesn't have much features.
      Pong (1 player)
        Playable.
      Breakout (1979, Carmelo Cortez)
        Kind of works, but am not sure if the walls are supposed to regenerate.
      Breakout (David Winter)
        Use this one. The other breakout is janky
